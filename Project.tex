\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Purpose}

TrackMe is a company aiming to support interactions between users, who like keeping track of the health status and their activities, and third parties which can use data and enhance their value.

TrackMe app is composed of three main important service:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data4Help: basic support for health data.
\item AutomatedSOS: add support for SOS services to elderly people. 
\item Track4Run: add support for running events.
\end{itemize}

Each of them will have as targets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individuals users
\item Third parties.
\end{itemize}
Since each service serves both the targets, the project consist of a platform split in an iOS application and an API endpoint to sell and distribute data to third parties.

The system allows individual users to add and handle data on the app and to third parties to request and have access to these data.

In particular, a user of the application is able to keep track of his/her position during the activities but also during the normal day-life. The users’ data are used to monitor the heartbeat and eventually to send an AutomatedSOS.
Furthermore, trackMe, is able to track all the athletes (that are using the application), during a run previously organized. Indeed TrackMe’s app provide a section to setup a group run , specifying the path and other useful information.

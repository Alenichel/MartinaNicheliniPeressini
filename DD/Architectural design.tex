\subsection{Overview: High-level}

The system is going to be implemented with a three tier architecture. Tiers are  as briefly described by the following schemas.

	\caption{High level view of the system's architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=8.00cm,keepaspectratio]{Figures/ThreeTierSchema}
	\caption{Distribution of application's function among the tier}
\end{figure}

The decision of this kind of architecture has been taken in order to build the system in the most modular possibile way:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Mobile clients}: users will be given with a iOS application which will be a view of the entire system.
	\item \textit{Third parties}: third parties will be given with a light web interfaces to register/manage API access and they will be authorised to communicate with the system.
	\item \textit{Logic layer}: logic layer will implement all the logic of the entire system, it will be host on premises machine.
	\item \textit{Data layer}: data layer will be implemented in third party's cloud system.
\end{itemize}

The idea is to keep as separate as possibile the logic layer from the data layer in order to let the system grow in a modular fashion and let us change cloud data provider as the system's dimension grow with the minimum effort.

\subsubsection{API structure}

All the api system will be implemented referring to a single endpoint www.data4help.cloud. Users' applications and third parties will refer to different subdomain:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{www.data4help.cloud/api/users} will be the specific endpoint for the application that serves users.
	\item \textit{www.data4help.cloud/api/thirdparties} will be the specific endpoint for thirdparties.
\end{itemize}

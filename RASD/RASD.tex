\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose} 

TrackMe is a company aiming to support interactions between users, 
who like keeping track of their health status and activities, and
third-parties, which can use data and enhance their value.

To do so, TrackMe thought about a software-based service, Data4Help, 
composed as follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data4Help: provides basic support for health and location data retrieving and sharing 
\end{itemize}

and two advanced services which relay on the first one: 

\begin{itemize}
\item AutomatedSOS: adds support for SOS services to elderly people;
\item Track4Run: adds support for running events.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Services abstract structure.}
\end{figure}

The project consists of a platform divided in a mobile application and 
a web-based interface to serve third-parties.
The system allows users to add and handle health data on the app
and to the third-parties to request and have access to that data.
In particular, a user of the application is able to keep track of 
his/her position during the activities but also during the normal 
day-life. 
AutomatedSOS and Track4Run are two ancillary services, also offered by
Data4Help, to serve elderly people in case of emergency and runners 
respectively.

\newpage
\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{Description of the problem}

Nowadays a lot of people track their activities with smartphones or
wearable devices. For this reason, TrackMe provides a new
complete user experience allowing users to read briefly the 
information about their activities and health status through Data4Help 
application. \newline
Data4Help is also thought for third-parties: acquiring data and 
extrapolate information from that is fundamental in today's world so 
TrackMe thought about a web service where organisations can retrive data choosing between single users or groups of 
individuals, also signing a subscription plan. \newline
Builded on top of Data4Help, AutomatedSOS provides support to elderly 
people in case of emergency (when vital parameters are detected 
under/above certain thresholds) and Track4Run aims to satisfy 
running-lovers, letting them organise new group's runs and 
live-tracking participants during the events.

\subsubsection{World Phenomena}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{General user’s health condition}: the machine doesn’t know the information about possible user’s disease
	\item \textit{First aid services status}: the machine doesn’t know the actual first aid services status
	\item \textit{Overall third-parties knowledge status}: the machine doesn’t know which informations third-parties already have about users
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Machine Phenomena}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Third-parties registration}
	\item \textit{User's registration}
	\item \textit{Data anonymisation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Shared Phenomena}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Vital parameters}: the machine can read vital parameters of the user such as BPM
	\item \textit{User's location}: the machine knows or can read actual and past user’s location
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Overall description}

\subsection{Product perspective}
\subsubsection{Class Diagram}
The product perspective of TrackMe is now explained using the UML paradigms.
The main classes of the UML are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User} contains all the information about a user like username, password, fiscalCode, hometown, elderly, runners.
	\item \textbf{Third-Parties} contains all the information about the registered organisation.
	\item \textbf{Data} is an abstract class that has two concrete classes: 
		\textbf{Health data} and	 \textbf{Location data}
	\item \textbf{Running Event} 
	\item \textbf{Location} contains information like the start point and the end point of a running event.
\end{itemize}

A user creates an Event specifying the path ie the starting location, the ending location and some specific interesting point along the path.
After the creation some user can join in.
An organisation, as explained above, can subscribe to a feed of data or directly to a single user.

\subsubsection{State Diagram}
The whole system can be also seen as a set of different services relying on the main module Data4Help.
Here we describe the main aspects of them with state diagrams.

\subsection{Product functions}
The software developed by TrackMe include three different services:
Data4Help supports user's data acquisition through wearable devices, AutomatedSOS, a personalised and non-intrusive SOS 
service for elderly people and Track4Run, a service to track athletes 
participating to a run.
Data4Help is also a service available for third-parties: in fact, 
organisations can request data to TrackMe and collect them for 
pursuing their objectives.
Data acquisition can be performed in two different way: directly to a
single user or to a groups of individuals.
Concerning the single user case, companies, through a social security
code, ask permission to access the corresponding information. 
In the other case, organisations can request, directly to TrackMe,
data of group of individuals with particular properties (e.g. users 
between 20 and 30 years old or living in a certain district).
In the latter, TrackMe provides data only if it can anonymised them
correctly.
AutomatedSOS it’s great for those elderly people who want to monitor 
their health status and have the support of an ambulance in case their
vital parameters are under certain thresholds.
Track4Run it’s a service dedicated to the runners: it offers the 
possibility to organise a run between other runners, define the path 
and the duration, allowing the invited ones to en-roll. In addition, 
Track4Run users who do not partecipate to the run can see live time 
on a map the position of all the runners. 
Finally, Track4Run supports the synchronisation of data with 
Data4Help.

All the goals presented in section \ref{goals} are going to be 
implemented. Here we describe deeply the requirements needed to
implement application's functions.
	
\begin{enumerate}[label={[R\arabic*]}]
    	\item Users can create an account with credentials.
    	\item Credentials can be retrievable also if forgotten/lost.
    	\item Users can log manually or automatically their data.
    	\item Users have to be able to accept/deny access to single data access request.
    	\item Users have to be able to see current data policies and to change them.
    	\item The machine has to be able to read health and position data.
		\item The machine has to be able to recognise below threshold parameters.
		\item The machine has to be able to communicate with third-parties.
		\item The machine has to be able to recognise data fragmentation level.
		\item The machine has to be able to store users’ data. 
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\subsection{Users characteristics}
\textbf{Users}: any person that will use the service to keep track of health data, positioning or automated SOS during any kind of activities (walking or running during a lone run or an organised event).\\\
\textbf{Third-parties}: Organisation or other parties interested in the acquisition for their usage of the data provided by the user activities.

\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}

\subsubsection{Domain assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}[label={[D\arabic*]}]
    	\item Data manually inserted by users are to be considered 
    	truthful   
    	\begin{enumerate}[label={[D\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*]}]
    			\item Data are up to date.
    			\item Data are correctly formatted.
  		\end{enumerate}

    	\item First aid services are ready to handle emergency notifications.  		
  		\item Running paths proposed by users are well formed (e.g: legit by law).
  		\item External services are reliable (map services).
  		\item Users can be localised trough GPS:
  		\begin{enumerate}[label={[D\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*]}]
    			\item GPS service is reliable.
    			\item GPS service is accurate enough to track runners during workouts.
  		\end{enumerate}
  		\item Users are not affected with diseases that can influence heartbeat ratio.
  		
\end{enumerate}

	\newpage
	\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
	Data4Help is a software application that does not export any 
	hardware interface; instead, at the final user is required a 
	smartphone and at the third-party is required a web browser. 
			
	\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data4Help} \newline 
		User's health data can be inserted in Data4Help section of the
		application manually or automatically synchronised with data
		acquired by individual's wearable devices. \newline
		In order to be cross-platform, the application is going to communicate with wearables through the Health Manager component of the operative systemss. \newline
		Third-parties can access to the different data through a 
		web-based interface in which, in case the organisation is 
		interested in the information of some specific individual, 
		can select the single user by his/her fiscal code and send to
		him/her the request of data's visualisation; instead, in 
		case of interest in accessing data of groups of individuals, 
		companies can select the parameters of interest and send to 
		TrackMe the request on hold for a positive response.
		\item \textbf{AutomatedSOS} \newline
		AutomatedSOS works on data collected by Data4Help to 
		guarantee the safety of elderly people. \newline
		In case of emergency, a pop-up will be showed to the customer
		checking if everything is alright; if no answer is given,
		an ambulance will reach the location of the user.
		\item \textbf{Track4Run} \newline
		Since Track4Run aims to schedule and organise runs for the 
		users of the service, it makes use of an external calendar
		service to allow individuals to create and en-roll races. 
		\newline
		For those who do not participate to the runs, Track4Run 
		features the possibility to see live-time the position of
		the runners.
	\end{itemize} 
	
	\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
	The system is going to use an API based communication system to 
	serve both the mobile application and the third-parties. \newline
	Data will be exchanged in multi-platform data formats such as 
	JSON or XML.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	The application is designed to be consumed by Italian citizens. 
	We estimate around 30k users at app launch, with around 10\% 
	simultaneously active.
	We estimate that once the application will be brought over onto
	the Android platform, the total users count will increase by 25\%,
	topping at about 38k users.
	The application will be able to adapt to the users active 
	concurrently.

\subsection{Design Constraints}

	\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
	The software application should handle a big amount of data, 
	stored online on third-parties' servers. 
	It also should manage a great number of simultaneous requests 
	when, in example, third-parties ask to access data or during the
	period of enrolment to a run.
	
	\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
	TrackMe is a software application available only on iOS devices. 
	It requests an internet connection (WiFi, 3G, 4G/LTE) and 
	GPS connectivity. \newline
	Some functionalities are available only for the owners of 
	wearable devices. 

	\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
	The application needs to access to the current location of the 
	user. It also may need to access individual's contact list to
	easily find possible user's friends. 
	
\newpage
\subsection{Software System Attributes}	

	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	The application and the external services offered by the
	application must be available 24/7. \newline
	Servers' maintenance, communicated to the user in advance
	and only during determined hours of the day, is the only 
	exceptions accepted. 
	
	\subsubsection{Availability}
	TrackMe services are available only in Italy for free.
	
	\subsubsection{Security}
	The security and privacy of the final user's will be guarantee by 
	TrackMe storing data and sensitive information only on encrypted 
	servers. \newline
	For online transactions, secure internet protocols are going to
	be adopted. 
	
	\subsubsection{Maintainability}
	The application software has to be scalable to allow the
	introduction of new functionalities in the future. 
	Cross-platform libraries should be adopted to ensure portability 
	to new operative system. 
	
	\subsubsection{Portability}
	Portability to the Android operating system will be take into 
	consideration after a first initial phase of development dedicated
	to the iOS market. \newline
	The application will also be constantly updated to guarantee 
	compatibility to an increasing number of wearable devices.

\subsection{Scenarios}

	\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
	Tim has to sustain an important medical exam aimed to discover if 
	he suffers or not of tachycardia. He has available the latest 
	model of smartwatch that supports the EGC monitor so his doctor 
	suggests to use Data4Help to monitor for 24/48 hours his heart 
	rate. Data4Help allows Tim to just use his smartwatch, instead of 
	the classic Dynamic ECG machine, for registering his heart’s data 
	in the app so that his doctor, after committing a request to Tim 
	through his fiscal code, can examine the results after few hours 
	by the end of the test and give to Tim a response in a very short 
	time. 

	\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
	Fitness \& More is a brand new sport center situated near a very
	big residential area with many educational institutions from 
	elementary to high schools. The centre offers swimming and tennis
	lessons with expert instructors and also a well supplied gym with
	personal coaches. \newline
	Fitness \& More asks to TrackMe the access to weight and height 
	data of kids between 6 and 19 year old who live in the above 
	mentioned area to make an analysis of the presence of overweighted
	individuals and so sponsor its sport center. 
	
	\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
	Gianna is an elderly who live alone. She is followed by a 
	caregiver and, during her absence,  she relies on AutomatedSOS 
	service: her vital parameters (like heart rate, SpO2…) 
	are acquired by her wearable device and, in case of
	sub threshold/above threshold values, an ambulance is 
	automatically advised to reach Gianna’s location. 

	\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
	The next PolimiRun will be held on the 11th of November in Lecco.
	Polisport, the sport organisation of the Politecnico di Milano, 
	decided to arrange a few workouts for the runners who are 
	attending the competition and so they suggest to use Track4Run to
	manage the path of the workouts around the city of Milan and also
	to let runners en-roll the training sessions.

\section{Formal analysis using Alloy}

In this section we give a description of the system trough and Alloy model.
The following relations are described:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data access request system is described. Third-parties can access users' data
		if a previous request has been made and approved.
	\item SOS events are raised in case of low vital parameters.
	\item Users can join to running events.
\end{itemize}
The following assumptions are taken in order to make the model cleaner:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All not necessary (to Alloy model) attributes of entities are omitted.
	\item All entities that have to be unique are identified by a single integer field: \textit{ID}.
	\item Dates are represented trough a single integer field: \textit{day}.
	\item Threshold alert value for bpm is set to 4.
\end{itemize}
